SlackDotNet
===
*Note:* Currently this is very early and has limited functionality.

This library provides an interface for interacting with the Slack API.
Currently this provides a WebhookMessage model for use in data binding to requests from Slack.
Also, it provides the ability to post messages (and ephemeral messages) to slack.
